## ✅ Frontend Phase 3 — COMPLETE

### Desktop Kiosk Deliverables

| File | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `desktop/src/App.tsx` | ✅ Done | Routes: `/` (Auth), `/exam` (Protected), `/summary` (Protected), `/complete`. ProtectedRoute guard via localStorage `exam_session`. |
| `desktop/src/pages/AuthPage.tsx` | ✅ Done | 3-step auth: CONNECTING (edge health check) → SCAN_QR (barcode scanner input + simulate button) → FACE_VERIFY (webcam + face guide overlay + capture). Error/success states with retry. |
| `desktop/src/pages/ExamPage.tsx` | ✅ Done | Full exam UI: question content, A/B/C/D options with selection glow, question palette (answered/flagged/current), SVG timer ring (orange < 5min), Previous/Next/Flag/Review buttons, focus-loss monitoring, auto-save via `submitAnswer()`. |
| `desktop/src/pages/SummaryPage.tsx` | ✅ Done | Review panel: candidate name, exam, total/answered/unanswered counts. Auto-submit on timer expiry. "Confirm Submission" → POST `/exam/submit` → navigate `/complete`. |
| `desktop/src/pages/CompletePage.tsx` | ✅ Done | Success screen: ✓ circle, submission hash in monospace, answers count. Clears localStorage session. "Return to Login" resets. |
| `desktop/src/services/edgeApi.ts` | ✅ Done | Full typed HTTP client: `authenticate()`, `supervisorOverride()`, `getSession()`, `submitAnswer()`, `submitExam()`, `checkSnapshot()`, `restoreSession()`, `reportMonitoringEvent()`, `checkEdgeHealth()`. All types exported. |
| `desktop/src/index.css` | ✅ Done | 662-line premium dark design system: glassmorphism cards, ambient gradients, QR scan frame + scan-line animation, webcam frame + face-guide oval pulse, MCQ option buttons with selection glow, question palette pills, SVG timer ring, progress bars, spinner, check-circle pop animation, utility classes. |
| `desktop/electron/main.js` | ✅ Done | Kiosk config: fullscreen, frameless, no devtools, context isolation, keyboard shortcut blocking (Ctrl+Shift+I, F12, Ctrl+W). |

### Integration Notes

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Edge API client uses `http://localhost:8001/api/v1` | ✅ |
| Auth uses edge-local RS256 JWTs (no Clerk) | ✅ |
| Monitoring events (focus loss) reported to `/monitoring/event` | ✅ |
| Answer submission auto-saves with snapshot via `/exam/answer` | ✅ |
| Recovery flow typed in `edgeApi.ts` (checkSnapshot, restoreSession) | ✅ |
| ProtectedRoute prevents `/exam` and `/summary` access without session | ✅ |
